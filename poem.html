    <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>Then there's a pair of us!<br>Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!</p>
    <p><br><br>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>How public - like a Frog -<br>To tel one's name - the livelong June -<br>To an admiring Bog!</p>
    <o><br><br>By <em>Emily Dickinson (1891)</em></o>
